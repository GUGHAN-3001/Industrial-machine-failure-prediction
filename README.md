# Industrial-machine-failure-prediction

Industrial machine failure refers to the breakdown or malfunction of machinery used in industries,
which can lead to production delays, increased costs, and safety hazards. These failures can result from
wear and tear, faulty components, poor maintenance, or unexpected operational conditions. Examples
include motor failures, component fatigue, overheating, and mechanical breakdowns.
Machine learning can help predict these failures before they occur by analyzing patterns in historical
machine data, allowing businesses to take preemptive measures (predictive maintenance). Hereâ€™s how
machine learning can be used to predict and rectify industrial machine failures:

# Data Collection

Industrial machines generate large amounts of sensor data over time. This can include data such as:
Vibration levels
Temperature
Pressure
Voltage/current
Operating time
Error logs
This data is usually collected in real-time from sensors embedded in machines.

# Data Preprocessing

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
import xgboost as xgb

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/admin/OneDrive/Desktop/IBM DATATHON/predictive_maintenance_dataset.csv")

# Check the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Handling missing values: Drop rows or fill missing data (depending on the data)
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Convert the date column to datetime format
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])

# Extract useful components from the date, such as year, month, and day
data['year'] = data['date'].dt.year
data['month'] = data['date'].dt.month
data['day'] = data['date'].dt.day

# Optionally, drop the original 'date' column if it's no longer needed
data = data.drop(columns=['date'])

# Check if all columns are numeric
print(data.dtypes)

# Identify non-numeric columns
non_numeric_cols = data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
print("Non-numeric columns:", non_numeric_cols)

# If you want to drop non-numeric columns
data.drop(columns=non_numeric_cols, inplace=True)

# Drop the target column ('failure') before scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.drop(columns=['failure']))

# Convert scaled data back to DataFrame and re-add the 'failure' column
data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns=data.columns[:-1])
data_scaled['failure'] = data['failure'].values  # Assuming 'failure' is the target

# Display the cleaned and scaled data
print(data_scaled.head())

```

# Feature Engineering
The raw data collected from sensors may need to be pre-processed to extract meaningful features.
These could include:
Average and peak values of temperature or pressure.
Vibration frequency.
Time between errors.
Machine load during operation.
Feature engineering helps extract useful indicators of failure patterns.

### Labeling Data
Historical machine data is often labeled with failure events. For instance, the machine might have
experienced a failure on a specific date, and the data leading up to that failure is tagged. This helps in
training the machine learning model to recognize failure patterns.

# Model Training
Various machine learning models can be used to predict machine failures, including:
Classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural
Networks) to predict whether a failure will occur.
Regression models to predict the time remaining until a failure (Remaining Useful Life, RUL).
Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to identify unusual patterns
in machine behavior that could indicate a potential failure.

# Prediction
Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions about future machine failures. For
example:
The model might predict that a failure will occur within the next 30 days based on current sensor
data.
It could also flag anomalies in real-time machine data to indicate potential issues.

# Preventive Actions
After predicting a failure, the system can trigger maintenance alerts, allowing companies to:
Perform preventive maintenance (fixing potential issues before they become failures).
Optimize the maintenance schedule to minimize downtime.
Order spare parts in advance to avoid delays in repairs.
Example Approach:
Predictive Maintenance Workflow:
1. Collect sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, etc.) from machines.
2. Preprocess the data and extract important features.
3. Label the data with historical failure information.
4. Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) on this data.
5. Use the model to predict the likelihood of machine failure.
6. Take preventive actions when the model predicts a high chance of failure.
By implementing machine learning for failure prediction, industries can significantly reduce
unexpected downtime, maintenance costs, and improve the overall efficiency of their operations
